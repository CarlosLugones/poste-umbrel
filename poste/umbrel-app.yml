  Poste.io is a complete, self-hosted mail server solution bundling SMTP, IMAP,
  and POP3 with built-in antispam (Rspamd), antivirus (ClamAV), and a webmail
  client (Roundcube) — all in a single Docker container.


  Key features:

  - Full SMTP/IMAP/POP3 support with modern encryption (ports 993/995)

  - Spam filtering via Rspamd and virus scanning via ClamAV

  - Webmail via Roundcube

  - Native SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and SRS support with a setup wizard

  - Web-based admin panel with multi-domain and multi-user management

  - Autodiscovery for Thunderbird and Microsoft mail clients


  Before using this app you need a domain name with proper DNS records
  (MX, SPF, DKIM) and port forwarding on your router for ports 25, 587,
  993, and 995. Set your mail hostname by creating a .env file in the app
  directory with MAIL_HOSTNAME=mail.yourdomain.com, or configure it via
  the poste.io setup wizard on first boot.
